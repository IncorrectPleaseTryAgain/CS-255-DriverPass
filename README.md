# CS-255 DriverPass

###### Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project was a systems design project. The client was Liam and he wanted to provide people with better drivers training. He decided to ask us to create an online system for him that would allow people to take extra driving lessons and to learn everything they need to know before taking their drivers exam. The system needed to do three things, manage online classes, manage practice exams, and provide road training.

###### What did you do particularly well?

I believe that I prepared for the system appropriately. My planning and requirements document was well done and in depth. I made sure to add all necessary details and explanations to ensure that the system would be exactly what the client wanted. The language that I used in my design documents were appropriate to the desired audience.

###### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I had to change or revise one part of one of these documents then it would have to be the system design document. I believe that I could have spent more time designing each diagram and making sure that they covered every angle of the system. I ran into some issues of running out of 'nodes' that I could place in the diagrams because I was using a free online diagram designer which limited my scope. I would have loved to see a more in-depth and fully designed design document.

###### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The user's needs are one of the most important if not the most important aspect to consider when designing any system. The reason for this is because the user will be the one using the system and experiencing it fully. I tried to include this into my design by making the design of the system easy to use and very user friendly. It is important to consider the investors and the client; however, their profits will go up in relation to the users' satisfaction with the system because without them there would be no audience for the system.

###### How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

When designing a system, it is important to follow the Software Development Life Cycle. When focusing on the first step, planning, we need to go deeper into figuring out how to plan. Firstly, it is important to know what you are planning for so having a good idea about what the system will entail and what it will be used for is essential. After learning more about the system and getting the system requirements it is important to design a timeline. We can do this by using a Gantt chart. Using multiple diagrams to help design each part of the system is important; however, it is fairly time consuming so having a process and object diagram on a high level is more important at this stage. The more complex a system is and the more the system will be modified/revised in the future will determine which diagrams will be used and how many will be used. Finally, it is extremely important to consider both the functional and non-functional requirements when designing and analyzing a system.
